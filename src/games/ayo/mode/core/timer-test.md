# Timer Implementation Test Cases

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Initial Game State
- **Expected**: Both players have 10:00 timer, timer is paused
- **Test Steps**: 
  1. Start new game
  2. Check timer display for both players
  3. Verify timer is not running

### 2. Player Turn Start
- **Expected**: Player 2 timer starts counting down, Player 1 timer is paused
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Start game (AI goes first)
  2. Wait for AI turn to complete
  3. Verify Player 2 timer starts counting down
  4. Verify Player 1 timer is paused

### 3. Turn Transition
- **Expected**: Timer pauses when turn ends, resumes for next player
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Player 2 makes a move
  2. Timer pauses during animation
  3. Animation completes
  4. Timer resumes for Player 1 (AI)

### 4. AI Turn
- **Expected**: Timer is paused during AI thinking time
- **Test Steps**:
  1. AI turn starts
  2. Verify timer is paused
  3. AI makes move
  4. Timer remains paused until animation completes

### 5. Timer Expiration
- **Expected**: Game ends when timer reaches 0
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Set timer to 10 seconds for testing
  2. Wait for timer to reach 0
  3. Verify game over alert appears
  4. Verify correct player wins

### 6. Visual Feedback
- **Expected**: Active player's timer is highlighted
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Start game
  2. Verify AI timer is highlighted during AI turn
  3. Player turn starts
  4. Verify Player timer is highlighted

### 7. Game Over
- **Expected**: Timer stops when game ends
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Complete game (all seeds captured)
  2. Verify timer stops
  3. Verify no further countdown

## Integration Points

### Timer ↔ Game Logic
- ✅ Timer state integrated into AyoGameState
- ✅ Timer control based on currentPlayer changes
- ✅ Timer expiration triggers game over

### Timer ↔ UI
- ✅ Timer display in PlayerProfileCompact
- ✅ Active player highlighting
- ✅ Time formatting (MM:SS)

### Timer ↔ Animations
- ✅ Timer pauses during animations
- ✅ Timer resumes after animations complete

## Edge Cases

### Rapid Turn Transitions
- **Expected**: Timer state remains consistent
- **Test**: Rapidly switch between players

### Component Unmount
- **Expected**: Timer intervals are cleaned up
- **Test**: Navigate away from game during active timer

### Network Issues (for online mode)
- **Expected**: Timer continues running locally
- **Test**: Simulate network delay during turn

## Performance Considerations

### Timer Updates
- ✅ Updates every 100ms for smooth countdown
- ✅ Uses useRef for interval management
- ✅ Proper cleanup on unmount

### React Performance
- ✅ Memoized timer functions
- ✅ Minimal re-renders
- ✅ Efficient state updates

## Code Quality

### TypeScript
- ✅ Proper type definitions
- ✅ Interface consistency
- ✅ Error handling

### Best Practices
- ✅ Custom hook for timer logic
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Clean component architecture

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Release

- [ ] Check visual feedback on different devices
- [ ] Test with slow animations
- [ ] Verify game over conditions

### Monitoring
- [ ] Track timer-related bugs
- [ ] Monitor performance impact
- [ ] Collect user feedback

## Known Issues (if any)

None identified in current implementation.
